Curated app store for stillOS

This is a curated app store for stillOS. The curation allows us to ensure all listed apps work well in stillOS, as well as apply permissions patches automatically for Flatpaks, and add other types of non-Flatpak packages in the future without having 4 different ways to install the same app.
